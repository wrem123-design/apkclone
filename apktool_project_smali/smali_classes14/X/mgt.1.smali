    message = "Use ParcelableArgs instead. Passing non-parcelable arguments to fragments is strongly discouraged as it can lead to app crashes during fragment lifecycle events (e.g., configuration changes or process recreation). Non-parcelable arguments are stored in a singleton object store which may be cleared by the Android system, resulting in lost props and crashes."
